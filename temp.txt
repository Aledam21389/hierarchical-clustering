points-idex
np matrix- index

get splinter element
- find argmax
- create a new cluster
- remove splinter element from old cluster

-distance comparisons
-take splinter element column- delete splinter element row drom list (distances to splinter element)
- from matrix- remove splinnter element row and col- find row-wise avg (avg dist within cluster)

subtact distances (splinter element-cluster)

if +ve, do not change
if -ve move element to splinter cluster and remove from prev cluster



don't let length of cluster go to zero
